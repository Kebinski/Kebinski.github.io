    <p>GitHub was created for developers by developers. To build the best platform for you, we need to build a company that reflects the world we live in today. Since 2016, we’ve released annual diversity reports to hold ourselves accountable to our employees and the GitHub community.</p>
    <p>In our third annual report, we examine our employee population by location, gender identity, racial and ethnic background, age, and for the first time, share data on upward mobility. We hope these reports will continue to push GitHub’s culture forward—and encourage transparency and accountability in the tech industry and in businesses around the world. No single company or team can change the status quo, but together, we can build change that matters.</p>

    <p>Read the <a href="https://blog.github.com/2018-09-12-diversity-inclusion-and-belonging-at-github-in-2018/">The GitHub Blog</a> to learn even more about the values and principles that guide the pursuit of our mission.</p>
